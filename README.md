### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
###### Hi, thanks for visiting my GitHub! :)
#### I'm NedoProgrammer, or undefined. I'm a learning programmer from Belarus, and uh..yeah :)
##### My main language is C#. I love it very much. I mean, who doesn't like syntax sugar? :)
###### Here are some of my projects:
- Diswords (soon) - A [Discord](https://discord.com/ "Discord") bot to play the famous russian game - ["Words"](https://github.com/NedoProgrammer/NedoProgrammer/blob/master/Words.md)!
- [MP4DurationEditor](https://github.com/NedoProgrammer/MP4DurationEditor "MP4DurationEditor") - A funny little tool to create *cursed long Discord videos*. (it will confuse most of the players)
- [WebmFun](https://github.com/NedoProgrammer/WebmFun "WebmFun") - Also a funny little tool to create *cursed infinite Discord videos*. (it will confuse the discord player)

###### I'm currently learning:
- C++
- Kotlin
- Unity
- More soon...?

###### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- **Anything :D**

Sorry for my English, it's not my native language. :(
