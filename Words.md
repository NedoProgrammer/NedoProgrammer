#### This is a very popular game. You can play it anywhere - at home, on the road, in line, in class :-)

#### The essence of the game - you need to make a chain of words on a given topic.

## Words game rules

##### The rules are very simple - the first player names a word on a given topic, the second player names a word, the first letter of which matches the last letter of the word named by the first player. Then the third player, and so on in turn.

## Warning

Some words in English are very rare, for example words that start on letter X. So these words will be excluded, and you'll need to name a word that matches the last letter **that is not excluded**, for example:

letterbox --> o, **not x**

That also relates to Russian. For example, **there aren't any words** thats start with: 

- Ь
- Ы
- Ъ
- Й (there are some words but they're also pretty rare)
